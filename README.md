## Configuration Instructions
### Resources 
Images, Gifs and related resource files used by the app need to be brought into scope of the project. 
  1. First, drag and drop any resources into the project file. 
  2. In Qt Creator: right-click on the main project directory and select 'Add new...'
  3. Add a resource file by selecting 'Qt' then 'Qt Resource File'. Give it a name. 
  4. Select the newly added resource file and choose 'Add prefix.' In the 'Prefix' text field, give a prefix name that will store your particular resource.(e.g. /images)
  5. Click 'Add files.' Choose the files you want from the opened file system.
  6. The files are now in the project scope and pathnames can be resolved.
